                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello, I'm Farhan. It's nice to meet you virtually! I'm a 2nd year Computer Science student at UNSW with a strong passion for front-end development. Beyond academics, I enjoy watching One Piece and reading Spider-Man comics. To stay healthy, I play football with my friends at the suburban level. When I'm at home, you'll find me either coding or playing video games, particularly FPS shooters.</p>

                    <div class="text">
                        <p>When I wake up each morning, the first thing I do is create a to-do list for the day. This essential step helps me optimize my time and stay productive.</p>
                        <p>During daylight hours, my personality is energetic, outgoing, and collaborative. I draw inspiration from the sunlight and the dynamic rhythm of daily life.</p>

                        <p>At night, my creative side emerges. As a night owl, I find myself most productive after dark. I prefer to complete assignments and weekly tasks during these quiet hours. Since many of my friends live in the US, Sydney's nighttime aligns with their day, allowing me to connect and play video games with them late into the evening.</p>
                        <p>My nighttime self becomes more reflective and introspective. The peaceful hours foster creativity, helping me discover deeper insights and fresh perspectives under the moonlight.</p>
